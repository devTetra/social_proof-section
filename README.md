## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Developer Tools

### What I learned

  Learned how to add two background images simultaneously and set their positions:

```css
body {
  background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg),url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg);
  background-position: left top,right bottom;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

  This webpage isn't very responsive so I need to improve on that
